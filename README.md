# RT-NET
**RT-NET** (real-time non-invasive electrophysiology toolbox), is a new software which can be used for online neural activity reconstruction from hdEEG. The goal is to allow researchers and neuroscientists to easily make use of the analysis steps for real-time brain reconstruction using hdEEG. Our toolbox will contribute to source-based neurofeedback experiments and to development of novel BCI applications based on hdEEG. Through RT-NET, it is possible to enable source-based neurofeedback experiments in one or two brain areas, and to visualize in 2D and 3D (on a 3D cortical model) the online brain activity.
 
**Before to start using it, please download the following packages and include in the RT-NET main folder**
